This project uses a strict AI-assisted engineering workflow.

All non-trivial tasks must pass through all five phases:

1. Problem Exploration  
2. Design  
3. Implementation  
4. Validation  
5. Review & Finalization  

Skipping phases is not allowed for production or assessment work.

--------------------------------
REQUIRED ARTIFACTS
--------------------------------

Every completed task must produce:

- clarified problem statement
- explicit assumptions
- algorithm or design summary
- production-grade implementation
- automated tests (when logic-heavy)
- review notes and trade-offs

--------------------------------
QUALITY BAR
--------------------------------

Solutions must demonstrate:

- correctness
- readability
- edge-case awareness
- maintainability
- test coverage
- explicit decision-making

--------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION RULE
--------------------------------

When delivering a solution, always include:

- Problem summary
- Approach
- Assumptions
- Trade-offs
- How to run tests
- How AI was used

--------------------------------
STOP CONDITIONS
--------------------------------

Do not conclude work until:

- assumptions are documented
- edge cases are addressed
- tests exist or are justified
- a review pass has occurred
